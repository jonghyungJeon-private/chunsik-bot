 * this port takes a plain path and does NOT depend on `WorkspaceRef` or any
 * Workspace type.
 *
 * Sprint 2b is **read-only**: no commit/checkout/branch/merge/reset/stash/push/
 * pull/fetch/tag/worktree. Implementations run git **adapter-side only**, via
 * argument-array spawn (never a shell string), with a timeout and the repository
 * root as cwd. Core never touches `child_process`. Write operations are a future
 * capability gated by Approval.
